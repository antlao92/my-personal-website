           Introduction
          </h3>
          <p>
            I am a aspiring software developer! I have traveled the world and 
            look forward to making my mark! I really enjoy spending time with my wife
            and looking for ways for self-improvement!
            I love working with people and learning of the different ways
            we as people can grow. I am passionate about my family, 
            sports, and helping people!

            Green Bay Packers

             <p>
              Ever since I could remember,
              I have loved the Green Bay Packers! I remember playing madden with 
              my childhood friend and wanting to pick the Oakland Raiders. 
              He would always pick them, so I picked the team right before, 
              which was the Green Bay Packers! I was hooked ever since!

                I love playing sports and watching sports!
                I used sports as a way to escape and develop discipline. 
                My parents and teachers remember me as a kid who couldn't keep still.
                While I have changed quite a bit, I still really enjoy sports and the 
                lessons that can be learned while playing or watching sports.

             <p>
              I have always liked the Houston Rockets as well. 
              I didn't get to spend a lot of time with my dad because he worked
              a lot. But when the rockets drafted Yao Ming, 7 foot 6 center from
              China, we bonded over him being in the NBA. I loved the team ever 
              since. Watching the rockets compete with Yao Ming and Tracy
              McGrady were unforgettable memories that I relish. I remember one
              game in particular where the T-mac scores 13 points in 33 seconds. 
              I remembered as a kid jumping up and down in disbelief as it was 
              happening on tnt. It was a sight to behold.
